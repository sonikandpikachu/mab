   - base - main settings file, defines settings which are equal for all users and site states.
   - buildbot - settings for buildbot builds.
   - dev - settings for development.
   - production and staging(if exists) - settings for concrete server(without secret info).
   - test - settings for testing.
   - custom - non-in-git settings - secret keys and other secret info for each machine.

2. Core - base app without models but with general helpers, utils and abstract objects.
